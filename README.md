## Technologies

* Jazz-Brite was built atop Ruby on Rails, a PostgreSQL database, and the Heroku platform.
* The Google Geocoding API looks up event addresses and sets the latitude and longitude.
* The IPinfo API locates users according to their IP address, thus allowing the app to highlight upcoming events in the user's local area.
* The Google Maps API combines event and user location data, giving users an external link to view directions on Google's site.
* The Facebook OAuth API enables users to login with their Facebook credentials and skip the hassle of creating a brand new account.
* To let users upload event pictures, Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 Bucket stores images and serves them back to the application.
* After an email invitation is sent, SendGrid delivers the email on behalf of the site.
* Bootstrap was utilized for general styling and for making the interface responsive across a wide variety of desktop and tablet devices.
* jQuery and AJAX let users transfer data to the server and immediately view a modified layoutâ€”all without leaving an event page. Activated during RSVPs for events, updates to the list of attendees, and updates to the attendee count.
